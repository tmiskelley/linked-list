# Linked-list
This repository is my implementation of a Linked list data structure for Ruby. I modeled the list itself and the nodes to be contained within the list in two seperate classes, then added several convenience methods to make the data structure easier to work with.

# How to use
To use this data structure, simply include it in your file, and create an instance of it as you would with a hash or an array; all methods can be called directly on the instance of the class.

You can use #append and #prepend to add items to the list, #pop to remove items, and several other useful methods for locating and working with the nodes in your list.
